<p>Well...</p>
<p>Imagine combining the thrill of stargazing with the satisfaction of building something from scratch. That's exactly what I've set out to do.</p>
<p>I've embarked on an exciting journey to master the Rust programming language through a hands-on, real-world project. My mission? To develop a telescope mount controller, step by step, as I grow my Rust skills. The heart of this project will be an ESP32-based 3D printer board, which will control the stepper motors responsible for positioning the mount.</p>
<p><img src="images/rust-logo-blk.svg" alt="The Rust Logo" /></p>
<p>But why take on such a challenge? Well, my recent exposure to Rust programming on ESP32s has ignited a passion to dive deeper into this powerful language. Simultaneously, I'm eager to explore the capabilities of the ESP32, particularly in the context of telescope mount control. As an aspiring amateur astronomer, I'm keen to elevate my stargazing game, but I'm not content with simply purchasing off-the-shelf solutions. Ultimately, I want pin-point stars in my astrophotography.</p>
<p>Sure, I could buy a ready-made mount, load up on software, and start observing right away. But where's the fun in that? I'm after the thrill of understanding the intricacies, of building something with my own hands (and code). Plus, let's be honest - those high-end astronomy mounts come with price tags that might make the Chief Financial Officer of my household raise an eyebrow or two.</p>
<p>At its core, an astronomy mount's job is to move along two axes to point at specific areas of the night sky. Sounds simple enough, right? So I thought to myself, "Why not build one?" After all, the basic premise doesn't seem too complex. How hard could it be?</p>
<p>Join me on this adventure as I attempt to marry the worlds of Rust programming, ESP32 microcontrollers, and amateur astronomy. It's going to be a learning experience, a test of perseverance, and hopefully, a whole lot of fun. Let's see if we can reach for the stars - both literally and figuratively!</p>

<p>💡<strong>TIP</strong> - I asked MetaAI to generate this image with this prompt "imagine a guy sitting in a lawn chair, drinking a beer, and a telescope beside him pointed upwards into the night sky, filled with galaxies".   I think it's a great visual of what I'm trying to accomplish. 👍</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a work in progress. I'm still working on the project, so expect some rough edges.  Also, I've created this book (using <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html">mdbook</a>) as a way to capture my thoughts on solving some of these challenges along the way.  I will/may miss stuff that the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">Rust Book</a> may cover, so please feel free to check it out.  I've realized i'm jumping all over the place, so, i'd like to call out that perhaps the end result doesn't actually show how i got there.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Further, this book is really just a reference for me, so I'm not going to spend a lot of time on it.  I'm going to try to keep it updated as I go along, but I'm not going to be a stickler for keeping it up to date in sync with the code.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am <strong>NOT</strong> a professional programmer!  I wanted to learn Rust, and I'm hoping that this project will help me do that.  Sure there are better ways to do something, but my mantra right now is "Git-R-Done".  I can work out later how to improve on this project.</p>

<p>This project is astronomy-based, so let's find/define what some of the usual terms mean, to give us a better insight as to what exactly we are dealing with.  It's not a comprehensive list, but it's a good start.</p>
<p><strong>Right Ascension</strong> (RA) is the celestial equivalent of longitude on Earth. It is the angular distance measured eastward along the celestial equator from the Sun's position at the vernal equinox (the First Point of Aries) to the hour circle passing through the celestial object in question. RA is measured in hours (h), minutes (m), and seconds (s), with 24 hours being a full circle or 360 degrees.</p>
<p><strong>Declination</strong> (Dec) is the celestial equivalent of latitude on Earth. It is the angular distance of a celestial object north or south of the celestial equator, measured in degrees (°), minutes ('), and seconds ("). Declination ranges from +90° at the north celestial pole to -90° at the south celestial pole, with 0° being the celestial equator.</p>
<p>Together, <strong>Right Ascension</strong> and <strong>Declination</strong> form the equatorial coordinate system used to specify the precise location of stars, planets, and other celestial objects on the celestial sphere.</p>
<p>A <strong>prime meridian</strong> is an arbitrarily-chosen meridian (a line of longitude) in a geographic coordinate system at which longitude is defined to be 0°. Together, a prime meridian and its anti-meridian (the 180th meridian in a 360°-system) form a great circle. This great circle divides a spheroid, like Earth, into two hemispheres: the Eastern Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere (for an east-west notational system). For Earth's prime meridian, various conventions have been used or advocated in different regions throughout history. Earth's current international standard prime meridian is the IERS Reference Meridian. It is derived, but differs slightly, from the Greenwich Meridian, the previous standard.</p>
<p><strong>Decimal degrees</strong> (DD) is a notation for expressing latitude and longitude geographic coordinates as decimal fractions of a degree. DD are used in many geographic information systems (GIS), web mapping applications such as OpenStreetMap, and GPS devices. Decimal degrees are an alternative to using sexagesimal degrees (degrees, minutes, and seconds - DMS notation). As with latitude and longitude, the values are bounded by ±90° and ±180° respectively.</p>

<h2 id="coordinate-systems"><a class="header" href="#coordinate-systems">Coordinate systems</a></h2>
<h3 id="longitude-and-latitude"><a class="header" href="#longitude-and-latitude">Longitude and Latitude</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>latitude</strong> (abbreviation: Lat., ϕ, or phi) of a point on Earth's surface is the angle between the equatorial plane and the straight line that passes through that point and through (or close to) the center of the Earth.[note 2] Lines joining points of the same latitude trace circles on the surface of Earth called parallels, as they are parallel to the Equator and to each other. The North Pole is 90° N; the South Pole is 90° S. The 0° parallel of latitude is designated the Equator, the fundamental plane of all geographic coordinate systems. The Equator divides the globe into <strong>Northern</strong> and <strong>Southern Hemispheres</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>longitude</strong> (abbreviation: Long., λ, or lambda) of a point on Earth's surface is the angle east or west of a reference meridian to another meridian that passes through that point. All meridians are halves of great ellipses (often called great circles), which converge at the North and South Poles. The meridian of the British Royal Observatory in Greenwich, in southeast London, England, is the international prime meridian, although some organizations—such as the French Institut national de l'information géographique et forestière—continue to use other meridians for internal purposes. The prime meridian determines the proper <strong>Eastern</strong> and <strong>Western Hemispheres</strong></p>

<h3 id="right-ascension--declination"><a class="header" href="#right-ascension--declination">Right Ascension &amp; Declination</a></h3>
<p><strong>Right Ascension</strong> (RA) is the celestial equivalent of longitude on Earth. It is the angular distance measured eastward along the celestial equator from the Sun's position at the vernal equinox (the First Point of Aries) to the hour circle passing through the celestial object in question. RA is measured in hours (h), minutes (m), and seconds (s), with 24 hours being a full circle or 360 degrees.</p>
<p><strong>Declination</strong> (Dec) is the celestial equivalent of latitude on Earth. It is the angular distance of a celestial object north or south of the celestial equator, measured in degrees (°), minutes ('), and seconds ("). Declination ranges from +90° at the north celestial pole to -90° at the south celestial pole, with 0° being the celestial equator.</p>
<p>Together, <strong>Right Ascension</strong> and <strong>Declination</strong> form the equatorial coordinate system used to specify the precise location of stars, planets, and other celestial objects on the celestial sphere.</p>
<p><strong>Astronomy catalogues</strong> use the <strong>International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF)</strong> to specify the location of celestial objects. The ICRF is a coordinate system based on the <strong>Equatorial Coordinate System (ECEF)</strong> and the <strong>International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS)</strong>. The ICRF is a <strong>right-handed</strong> coordinate system, with the origin at the centre of the Earth's equator at the vernal equinox (the First Point of Aries), and the axes oriented along the equator and the ecliptic plane. The ICRF is a <strong>spherical</strong> coordinate system, with a radius of 6378.137 km.</p>
<p>As an example, <strong>Messier 31 (M31)</strong>, better known as the Andromeda Galaxy, is a large spiral galaxy located in the constellation Andromeda. Lying at a distance of 2.54 million light years from Earth, the Andromeda Galaxy is the nearest major galaxy to our own. It is on a collision course with our home galaxy, the Milky Way. Messier 31 has an apparent magnitude of 3.44. Its designation in the New General Catalogue is NGC 224.  It's coordinates are:</p>
<p>RA: 00h 42m 44s
Dec: +41° 16' 09"</p>
<p>These coordinates are given in the J2000 epoch. It's worth noting that there are slight variations in the precise coordinates across different sources, which is common for large extended objects like galaxies. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>One source lists RA: 00h 42' 58", Dec: +41° 16' 32"</li>
<li>Another gives RA: 00h 41.8m, Dec: +41° 16'</li>
</ul>
<p>These minor differences are likely due to variations in measurement techniques or the specific part of the galaxy being referenced as the center point. However, all sources agree on the general location in the sky, placing Messier 31 in the constellation Andromeda.</p>
<p><img src="images/Messier-31-1024x673.jpg" alt="Andromeda Galaxy" /></p>
<p>So, provided we know where we are on the Earth (Latitude/Longitude), we should be able to find and point to the coordinates of any celestial object.</p>

<p><strong>Local Meridian</strong> - A local meridian is a meridian that is used to specify the longitude of a celestial object. For example, the local meridian of the Greenwich observatory is the Greenwich meridian, which is the international standard meridian for the United Kingdom.  Based on your location, the local meridian can be different from the international standard meridian, and is often referred to as the observatory meridian.</p>

<p><strong>Time</strong> is a measure of the duration between events. In scientific contexts, it's typically measured in seconds (s), though larger units like minutes (m), hours (h), days (d), weeks (w), and years (y) are also used.</p>
<p><strong>Julian Date (JD)</strong> is a continuous count of days and fractions thereof from the beginning of the Julian Period, starting at noon Universal Time on January 1, 4713 BCE (on the Julian calendar). It's widely used in astronomy for its simplicity in calculating time intervals.</p>
<p><strong>Gregorian Calendar</strong> is the internationally accepted civil calendar. It was introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582 as a reform of the Julian calendar. It has 12 months of varying lengths, with a leap year every four years (with some exceptions).</p>
<p><strong>J2000.0</strong> refers to the standard epoch used in astronomy, corresponding to 12:00 Terrestrial Time (TT) on January 1, 2000 in the Gregorian calendar. This equates to JD 2451545.0 (TT).</p>
<h3 id="time-scales"><a class="header" href="#time-scales">Time Scales</a></h3>
<p><strong>Universal Time (UT)</strong> is a time scale based on the Earth's rotation. There are several versions: UT0, UT1, and UT2, with UT1 being the principal form directly obtained from observations.</p>
<p><strong>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</strong> is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. It's based on International Atomic Time (TAI) with leap seconds added to keep it close to UT1.</p>
<p><strong>International Atomic Time (TAI)</strong> is a highly precise atomic coordinate time standard based on the SI second. It's the basis for other time scales.</p>
<p><strong>Terrestrial Time (TT)</strong> is a theoretical ideal time scale for observations from the surface of the Earth. It's essentially TAI + 32.184 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB)</strong> is a relativistic time scale intended for astronomical use, particularly for solar system ephemerides.</p>
<p><strong>GPS Time</strong> is the time scale used by the Global Positioning System. It's ahead of TAI by 19 seconds and does not include leap seconds.</p>

<p>Maybe the ESP32 just won't cut it...maybe I need something "stronger".  The RaspberryPI Zero 2W looks promising as the microcontroller, but i'd still have to design a board for the stepper motors.  I'm not sure yet.  I'll see how it goes.</p>
