# 1.3.1 - Typical setup

A typical setup for an astrophotography session involves several key components working together to capture images of celestial objects. Here's an overview of a common setup:

1. **Mount**: An equatorial mount (often a German Equatorial Mount or GEM) is the foundation of the setup. It provides precise tracking of celestial objects.

2. **Telescope**: This serves as the primary imaging instrument. Common types include refractors, reflectors, or catadioptric telescopes.

3. **Camera**: Usually a dedicated astronomical camera or a modified DSLR camera attached to the telescope's focuser.

4. **Guide Scope and Camera**: A smaller telescope and camera used for autoguiding, ensuring precise tracking during long exposures.

5. **Computer**: Used to control the mount, camera, and other equipment. It runs software like NINA for image acquisition and mount control.

6. **Power Supply**: A portable battery pack or power station to run all the electronic equipment.

7. **Dew Heaters**: To prevent condensation on optical surfaces.

8. **Filters**: Various filters may be used to enhance specific features or reduce light pollution.

Here's a typical workflow:

1. Set up the mount and ensure proper polar alignment.
2. Attach the telescope, cameras, and other accessories.
3. Connect all components to the computer and power supply.
4. Use software like NINA to:
   - Perform plate solving for precise pointing
   - Set up an imaging sequence
   - Configure autoguiding
   - Monitor the imaging process

5. During the session, the mount tracks the target while the camera captures multiple long-exposure images.
6. After the session, the captured images are processed and stacked to produce the final astrophotograph.
